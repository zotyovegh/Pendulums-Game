# Pendulums-Game

The project has been created for my Android course, therefore the final result of the development had to fulfil particular requirements and include features by given instructions.

The Pendulum Visualizer provides the user with an understanding of how a single and a double pendulum operates within different physical circumstances. The possibility is given, to adjust the physics of the environment in which the pendulums operate, for instance by changing their masses, modifying their length or updating their starting angles.

Additional important features:
* Dynamically interfering with the pendulums: By tapping on the screen, the current position of the pendulum can be adjusted.
* Save and reload different configurations
* The final product acquired the highest grade and greatly increased my interest in user-experience based development
